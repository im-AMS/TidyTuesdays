# Naruto

Data comes from **naruto.fandom.com**


The plot represents how powerful each team was **out of 100** (not including their Sensei). The data is from the official Data books released. Until now there have **been 3releases** of databooks covering from **E001 - E402**. The moon plot with the offset along x axis represents how strong each team is.
